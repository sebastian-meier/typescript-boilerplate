# TypeScript Boilerplace

This boilerplate is optimised for my personal Sublime Text 3 workflow.
It's meant to be used for backend code, no frontend optimisations included.

```
npm install
npm run watch
```

```
npm run lint
npm run build
```

nodemon for watching
tslint for linting
typescript (tsc) for building
